# Milestone1

## Feedback

The documentation for milestone1 could have had just a little more detail. It was very hard to discern what exactly is your audience, and purpose.  The use case is also a little sparse. Everything else is perfect, the Html is perfectly laid out, and your directory structure is exactly what we expect.

I would recommend spending just a little more time and try to layout exactly what you want to accomplish with your PWP

# Milestone2a 

## Corrections

your HTML is perfect but you needed to link to the wireframes in milestone2.php

## Feedback

The objectives you laid out in the content strategy section gave me a clear sense of what you wanted to accomplish with PWP. The same cannot be said about the wireframes. It was very hard for me to get a sense of what exactly your site was going to look like. (the crossed out boxes really confused me). Remember that wireframes are considered a deliverable to either a client or employer prior to finalizing UI layout and commencing development.

## Suggestions 

I recommend taking a little extra time nailing down what exactly your site is going to look like. You seem to know what goals are just not what the final product is going to look like. What is the purpose of the motto/Headline? Do you plan on having a nav bar that links back to specific sections of your site? For the links to GitHub, LinkedIn and Bugbunty (also the bugbunty link is an awesome idea) I recommend using faviconsIn the work section of your site how do you plan on displaying links to our portfolio? If you plan on using a third party tool I highly recommend using fancy-box from Fancy Apps. Past alumni have used fancy-box to great success. finally, What type of content do you plan on adding to the personal and academic sections on the site

### Grade: Tier II

I am going to go ahead and clear you to begin for on Milestone2b, but I highly recommend spending a little more time nailing down what the site is going to look like before you start
