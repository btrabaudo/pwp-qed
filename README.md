# Milestone1

## Feedback

The documentation for milestone1 could have had just a little more detail. It was very hard to discern what exactly is your audience, and purpose.  The use case is also a little sparse. Everything else is perfect, the Html is perfectly laid out, and your directory structure is exactly what we expect.

I would recommend spending just a little more time and try to layout exactly what you want to accomplish with your PWP
